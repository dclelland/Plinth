# Plinth

Simple matrix types for Swift with helpers for making vDSP operations.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Simply add Plinth to your `Package.swift` file: 

```swift
let package = Package(
    name: "Example",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/dclelland/Plinth.git", from: "2.0.0"),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "Example", dependencies: ["Plinth"])
    ]
)
```

Then import Plinth into your Swift files:

```swift
import Plinth
```

Or for full [`ComplexMatrix`](#complexmatrix) support you should also import [`swift-numerics`](https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics), as that's where the [`Complex`](https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics/blob/main/Sources/ComplexModule/Complex.swift) type lives. 

```swift
import Plinth
import Numerics
```

## Types

### [Shape](Sources/Plinth/Shape.swift)

Defines the shape of a matrix using `rows` and `columns` properties.

```swift
public struct Shape {
    
    public var rows: Int
    public var columns: Int
    
}
```

This includes a number of convenience properties like `count`, `length` and `breadth`; as well as convenience initializers `.row(length:)`, `.column(length:)` and `.square(length:)`. 

### [Matrix](Sources/Plinth/Matrix.swift)

Generic matrix struct with `Scalar` type argument and `shape` and `elements` properties. Elements are stored as a single array in row-major format.

```swift
public struct Matrix<Scalar> {
    
    public let shape: Shape
    public var elements: [Scalar]
    
}
```

This also includes a large number of convenience initializers and implementations of typical typeclasses such as `Codable` and `ExpressibleByArrayLiteral`.

The `elements` property is directly mutable but this is ideally to be avoided; matrix regularity is not enforced, except during encoding to or decoding from a serialization format.

There is a computed property `state` which can be used to check if the matrix is considered to be malformed:

```swift
let malformed = Matrix<Double>(
    shape: .init(rows: 2, columns: 2),
    elements: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
)

print(malformed.state)
```

```
> Malformed: Mismatched shape and elements; 2Ã—2 != 5
```

### [ComplexMatrix](Sources/Plinth/ComplexMatrix.swift)

Generic complex matrix struct encapsulating two separate matrices for the `real` and `imaginary` parts.

```swift
public struct ComplexMatrix<Scalar> where Scalar: Real {
    
    public var real: Matrix<Scalar>
    public var imaginary: Matrix<Scalar>
    
}
```

This also includes a large number of convenience initializers and implementations of typical typeclasses such as `Codable` and `ExpressibleByArrayLiteral`.

The `real` and `imaginary` properties are also directly mutable; `ComplexMatrix` has its own `state` property which can be used to check if the parts are mismatched or malformed.

## Core

### [Arithmetic](Sources/Plinth/Core/Arithmetic.swift)

`+` and `-` prefix operators and `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` infix operators.

Implements fast pointwise arithmetic for combinations of `Scalar`, `Complex<Scalar>`, `Matrix<Scalar>` and `ComplexMatrix<Scalar>`, where `Scalar` is `Float` or `Double`.

### [Conversions](Sources/Plinth/Core/Conversions.swift)

Fast type conversions between the integer types `UInt8`, `UInt16`, `UInt32`, `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32` and the floating point types `Float` and `Double`.

### [Functors](Sources/Plinth/Core/Functors.swift)

Higher-order functions for shape-preserving operations on a matrix's elements.

Includes support for complex matrix operations on [`DSPSplitComplex`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/dspsplitcomplex)/[`DSPDoubleSplitComplex`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/dspdoublesplitcomplex).

> Disclaimer: These are not true functors, Swift lacks higher-kinded types...

### [Submatrix](Sources/Plinth/Core/Submatrix.swift)

Fast submatrix read/write access using a Swift subscript interface.

> Uses Accelerate's [`vDSP_mmov`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/1449950-vdsp_mmov)/[`vDSP_mmovD`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/1449956-vdsp_mmovd).

### [Wrappers](Sources/Plinth/Core/Wrappers.swift)

Wrappers over most of the basic `vDSP` and `vForce` functions in Accelerate.

## Transformations

## Mathematics

### [Powers](Sources/Plinth/Extensions/Mathematics/Powers.swift)

`**` infix operator.

Implements fast pointwise power operations for `Scalar` and `Matrix`.

Includes special functions for taking integer powers of matrices, for use when successive application of `vDSP.multiply` will be faster than `vForce.pow` (which is quite an expensive operation). This also supports negative integers by applying `vDSP.reciprocal` to the result.
